# Atlas store lives in its own repository

This skill’s process memory is **not** authored here. It is mounted from `autogenesis-atlas` as the `references/atlas` submodule.

**Remote:** `https://github.com/sergio-sisternes-epam/autogenesis-atlas`

On a machine with git and Atlas CLI:

```text
atlas auth login --host github.com
atlas mount github.com/sergio-sisternes-epam/autogenesis-atlas --ref main --target references/atlas
```

Mount path = compile/query root: `references/atlas`  
Git root of the store **is** the OKF root (`SCHEMA.json`).
